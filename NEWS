Synnefo-wide
------------
* Standardize URLs for Synnefo Components:

  * impose structure and naming conventions to all URL related settings. Make
    each component deployable under a user-configurable <COMPONENT>_BASE_URL.
    Each API (compute, image, etc.) is deployable under a
    developer-configurable prefix beneath BASE_URL.

* Branding customization support across synnefo frontend components:

  * ability to adapt the Astakos, Pithos and Cyclades Web UI to a company’s
    visual identity. This is possible using the snf-branding component, which
    is automatically installed on the nodes running the API servers for
    Astakos, Pithos and Cyclades.


* Create a JSON-exportable definition document for each Synnefo Components
  (Astakos, Cyclades, Pithos, etc.) that consolidates APIs (services),
  resources, and other standardized properties (e.g. default URL prefixes).
* Implement common client for communication with Astakos and proper error
  handling.

Astakos
-------
* Redesign of the accounting system (quotaholder) and integration into
  Astakos.
* Implemented the keystone API call POST /tokens

  * Specified the API call allong with a procedure to register a Synnefo
    component (e.g. cyclades) along with the services it provides (e.g.
    compute, plankton) and the resources it handles (e.g. vm, cpu).

* All API calls are moved under '/account/v1.0'.
* Support API calls for quotas, commissions and resources.
* Improved user activation process
* Improve limit of pending applications by making it a quotable resource.
* Added fine grain user auth provider's policies.
* Overhauling of Astakos management commands for usability and uniformity.

Cyclades
--------
* Speed up private network creation, by creating a network to a Ganeti backend
  only when a server connects to that network.
* Rename management commands for commissions and resources for uniformity with
  other services.
* Synchronize Cyclades API with Openstack Compute v2.0 API.
