Synnefo
=======

Overview
--------

Synnefo is a complete open source cloud stack written in Python that provides
Compute, Network, Image, Volume and Storage services, similar to the ones
offered by AWS. Synnefo manages multiple
[Ganeti](http://code.google.com/p/ganeti)  clusters at the backend for handling
low-level VM operations and uses
[Archipelago](http://www.synnefo.org/docs/archipelago/latest/)  to unify cloud
storage. To boost 3rd-party compatibility, Synnefo exposes the OpenStack APIs
to users.
