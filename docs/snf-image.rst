snf-image
^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` is the secure image deployment tool used by the
synnefo's Compute Service, :ref:`cyclades <cyclades>`.

Currently, it is implemented as an OS definition for
`Ganeti <http://code.google.com/p/ganeti>`_.

Furthermore :ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` acts as a standalone add-on for Ganeti
and can be used with it independently. Someone who uses Ganeti, (and has
nothing to do with Synnefo) can use snf-image to serurely deploy many kind of
images with Ganeti.

Please refer to the
`snf-image documentation <http://www.synnefo.org/docs/snf-image/latest/index.html>`_ for
all details concerning installation and configuration.
