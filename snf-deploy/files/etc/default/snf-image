# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts

# VERSION_CHECK: Check if host and helper have the
# same version. This is usefull if snf-image-host is

# HELPER_TIMOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance.
# The helper instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited
# by itself. A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after
# a HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance
# is still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial
# signal was sent. The timeout values are integer numbers with an optional
