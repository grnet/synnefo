    Return a dictionary suitable for use in ``package_data``
    in a distutils ``setup.py`` file.

    The dictionary looks like::

        {"package": [files]}

    Where ``files`` is a list of all the files in that package that
    don"t match anything in ``exclude``.

    If ``only_in_packages`` is true, then top-level directories that
    are not packages won"t be included (but directories under packages
    will).

    Directories matching any pattern in ``exclude_directories`` will
    be ignored; by default directories with leading ``.``, ``CVS``,
    and ``_darcs`` will be ignored.

    If ``show_ignored`` is true, then all the files that aren"t
    included in package data are shown on stderr (for debugging
    purposes).

    Note patterns use wildcards, or can be exact paths (including
    leading ``./``), and all searching is case-insensitive.
